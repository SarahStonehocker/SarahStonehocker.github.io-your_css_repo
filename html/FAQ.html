    <p><strong>Refunds and Exchanges</strong></p>

    All sales are final. No refunds. Verify all information (title, date, time, seat selection, etc.) before purchasing tickets. Please Note: All ticket exchange requests must be made at least 24 hours before your scheduled performance. Requests made inside of 24 hours before or anytime after your scheduled performance will not be eligible for on-account credit, exchange, or refund.

    Subscribers may exchange tickets free of charge — one of the many subscriber benefits! Single-ticket holders may exchange for an additional fee ($5 per ticket). You may exchange tickets online, in person, or by phone for another performance within the same season, or receive on-account credit*. There is an additional cost if seating upgrades apply, and all exchange requests are subject to availability. You may also donate your tickets back to the Colorado Symphony and receive a donation receipt.

    Contrary to what many people think, formal attire like tuxedos and evening gowns are not required. They aren’t even the norm! Most concert-goers wear business or cocktail attire, but you’ll see everything from jeans and t-shirts to suits and ties. The name of the game is comfort.

    <p><strong>First and foremost, we want you to enjoy the music!</strong></p>

<div id="answer8">
 
    For the comfort and enjoyment of our musicians and patrons, late seating is at the discretion of the House Manager and takes place during pauses in the program. The ushers will let you know when you may enter the hall. They may seat you in an area other than your ticketed seat so as to not disturb other patrons, and you may take your ticketed seat during intermission.

</div>

<div id="answer9">

    You are welcome to bring drinks purchased at one of the bars into all concerts. Food is not allowed in the Hall, including food purchased in the Lobby. Please be courteous to your fellow concertgoers while consuming your beverages so as not to disrupt the concert.
